Recently I was lucky enough to get to attend Tech Inclusion in San Fransisco, a conference focused on 
Diversity and Inclusion work in tech. The company I am interning with was a sponsor of the conference
so I was able to go for free (shoutout to my manager for encouraging me to sign up). One great thing about
this was that, since I'm an intern and have very few responsibilities I was able to be wholly present for both days.

My overall impressions of the conference were positive. The first thing I noticed walking into the conference
centre was the diversity of the attendees. Working in tech spaces means that I spend most of my time surrounded
by white people, and men. At Tech Inclusion, I saw so many women, people of color and,  people with visible 
disabilities (in attendance and presenting) that I was actually kind of floored. Objectively, it is obviously a 
very low bar for a conference about _diversity and inclusion_ to have an inclusive and diverse attendee and speaker 
list. However, tech has disappointed me so consistently for 3 years that this was actually a really powerful 
experience. 

I definitely learned a lot by attending the panels, talks and workshops. A lot of the practical
information I gained seemed geared towards managers, so I'm going to try to summarize the important points and 
then share this post with people who can put it into action.

## Day One

On the first day of the conference I spent a lot of time attending talks on the "Disability in Tech" track of the
conference, as well as some talks about tech apprenticeships. 

### Opening Panel
The day kicked off with a panel titled [Driving Inclusion and Innovation in Workplace Culture](https://sf17.techinclusion.co/agenda/session/208340). The panel was comprised of the heads of D&I at three major tech companies. Candi Castleberry Singleton, at Twitter, Danny Allen at SAP, and Candice Morgan at Pinterest. 

Throughout all the discussions on the panel, a theme that came up a lot was that diversity and inclusion is _everyone's job_ which I think is said a lot and rarely taken seriously. When the panelists discussed their experiences as
heads of D&I, they said the hardest thing was getting managers at all levels to contribute to D&I work. The 
expectation is very often that hiring a D&I officer gives other executives, and managers at all levels, a free pass
to pawn off all work to this person.

This is clearly a ridiculous expectation, because it both makes the job of a D&I officer extremely difficult and 
ripe for burnout, and causes any change they create to be short-term and ineffective.

The main takeaway for me was that companies need to work much harder on holding management at all levels accountable
for Diversity and Inclusion work, so that policies are enforced and effective.

### Apprenticeship Talks
I attended one talk and one panel discussing apprenticeships in tech. [The talk](https://sf17.techinclusion.co/agenda/session/208362) was given by Vivek Nair, who bootstrapped Twilio's apprenticeship program. At Twilio, they are running
an apprenticeship program that is comprised of a 6 month training program followed by a decision on whether 
candidates will be hired. The main idea of apprenticeship programs are that tech companies pull in individuals with
diverse experiential backgrounds, and train them for a career at tech. After this general introduction Vivek 
explained the structure and steps taken in Twilio's apprenticeship program.

Viveks talk was followed by a panel entitled [Tech Apprenticeship: The Solution for Diversity and Talent Gaps](https://sf17.techinclusion.co/agenda/session/208363). The panel turned out to be very specifically about an apprenticeship
non-profit called Apprenti. The panelists discussed the success of the Apprenti program at Amazon and Avo. The most
important part of these programs, according to the panelists, was the effective mentorship they provided to the
apprentices. One prevailing idea in tech is that people should be able to figure things out on their own 
(see the snarky LMGTFY). The panelists argued against this mindset, explaining that for an apprenticeship program
to be successful, we have to accept that people will need assisstance to learn.

Although I think the idea of an apprenticeship program to bring people from outside of the tech world could be
effective in diversifying our spaces, I still found myself fairly skeptical.
    
A narrative being pushed at this panel, and the conference overall, was the idea that the problems that have 
been exacerbated by the tech industry's rapid and dangerous growth, including the wage gap, could be solved by 
"bringing more people in". I think this is a really dangerous idea. Tech is not going to save the world 
(at least not alone). I think the fact that apprenticeships can bring in people with more diverse backgrounds is definitely positive. However, I don't think that this should be presented as a "solution" to the wage gap. As people who 
work in tech we need to focus on working sustainably and responsibly with governments, non-profits and people. 
Spoiler: right now we are _not_. 

Another concern that I had was that apprenticeships may not actually bring in the demographic diversity that we hope.
People of color are disproportionately punished in the tech industry for not having formal degrees. Without a shift
in perceptions and culture, systemic discrimination will affect apprenticeship programs as much as regular hiring
processes.
